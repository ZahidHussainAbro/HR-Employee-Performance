in heatmap 18-25, 26-35 average performance rating then 55+ with the highest, also 46-55. in conclusion, we can see most of the groups have less difference.

we can see a comparison among different age groups by department and age daily satisfaction rate, The 55+ group has the highest than others the 2nd is 46-55 group and the second is very less 18-25 and 36-45 comparison is almost similar.

Lastly share of satisfaction by gender and marital status we can see males have the highest share as compared to females.
